# L-System Visualizer
A small python script for visualizing L-Systems

## Usage
Run the python script and enter the values it asks for.
I only tested it with example 4, 5 and 6 from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

## Requirements
It only requires Python 3.x and pygame

## TODO
- make the position and rotation saving and loading mechanism for the turtle work
- add more features
